"""Quality gate for injectrange.

Runnable as `python scripts/verify.py` from the project root. Standard library
only. Exits 0 when every check passes and 1 when any check fails, printing one
line per check and a final summary line.

The checks encode the lessons in _standards/LESSONS.md that can be verified
mechanically: SVG assets must parse and stay free of banned filters and illegal
comment sequences, no tracked text file may carry an em dash in any of its three
forms, README.md must avoid pandoc image attribute blocks and banned marketing
terms, every asset must be a labelled information graphic, and no two SVG text
labels sharing a baseline may overlap.
