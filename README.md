# InjectRange

</div>

| What this is | What this is not |
| --- | --- |
| A deterministic regression range for a prompt-injection guard you declare yourself. | A production filter. The reference guard is a plain substring matcher, nothing more. |
| A hash-pinned corpus of 24 short synthetic pattern skeletons, four in each of six breach classes. | A survey of real attacks. The entries are generic skeletons, not usable attack instructions. |
| A harness that tells you which named class opened, so a regression is legible. | A model test. It exercises the config you wrote, never a model, and there is no network access. |
| A tool for catching a guard that silently got weaker between two commits. | A security guarantee. Passing the range says the declared rules cover this corpus, and nothing more. |

InjectRange evaluates a locally declared guard configuration against a fixed,
hash-pinned corpus and records which breach classes the guard fails to close.
The output is a per-class matrix rather than a single headline number, so a
regression shows up as a named class opening rather than a score drifting by a
point. It tests the guard you wrote, not any model, and it never reaches the
network, so the same corpus and the same guard config always produce the same
result.

The rest of this document explains why the corpus is pinned, what each breach
class asks of a filter, how integrity is enforced, and how to read the two
reports. Every command block below was captured from a real run in this
session.


## Why a pinned corpus

A guard is a moving target. You add a rule to close one class, refactor the
matcher, tighten a normaliser, and three commits later a rule you thought was
redundant turns out to have been the only thing holding a class shut. Nothing
in a green test suite necessarily notices, because the guard still loads and
still blocks the obvious cases.

InjectRange exists to make that regression loud. The corpus is fixed and pinned
by a canonical digest, so the set of probes does not drift underneath you. When
the same corpus runs against two versions of your guard, any change in the
per-class result is attributable to the guard alone. If you want the corpus to
change, you change it deliberately, the digest moves, and the pin you commit
records that decision. A silent corpus edit cannot masquerade as a guard
improvement, because the loader refuses to run against a corpus that does not
match the pin.
